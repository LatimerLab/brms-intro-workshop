#### Script to work through how to use brms to fit a straightforward linear model ####
# 
# Workshop for lab meeting January 20, 2026
# 
# 1) compare linear mixed model using lme4 vs brms 
# 2) discuss the main brms settings and reason for them 
# 3) checking models for convergence 
# 4) some other model checks
# 5) a few model results plots 
# 6) posterior predictive checks
# 7) model comparison and evaluation
